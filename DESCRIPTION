Description: This package explores the pokemon API. The users can first create 
    a dataframe of the interested pokemons (our default is the 386 pokemons, 
    the first 3 generations). It then helps you generate a pokemon team. 
    You can also see the relevant stats of your team and create a graph 
    of the pokemon team including the selected pokemons.
