The world of Pokémon has captured the hearts and imaginations of people of all ages around the world. From its humble beginnings as a video game to its evolution into a massive media franchise spanning anime, movies, card games, and more, Pokemon has become a cultural phenomenon. As such, there is a great interest among fans to explore and analyze the vast amount of data surrounding this world. 

The goal of `pokemaster` is to explore the Pokémon API. This package exploits the information of the Pokémon of the first 3 generations (which corresponds to the ids 1 to 386). The users can first create a data frame of the Pokémons of interest. It then helps you generate a Pokémon team. You can also see the relevant stats of your team and create a nice flashcard of the team of the selected Pokémons. Our intended audience are Pokémon enthusiasts as well as gamers in general. For more general information about Pokémon, you can visit [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_National_Pok%C3%A9dex_number).

## Installation

You can install `pokemaster` package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("pokemaster")
```


You can install the development version of `pokemaster` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("harvard-stat108s23/pokemaster")
```

## About the Data

We are working with the [pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) which is available in JSON format. PokeAPI is a free, open-source web API that provides a comprehensive set of data on the Pokemon video game franchise. It allows developers, researchers, and fans to easily access a vast amount of information about the Pokemon universe, including details on individual Pokemon, their moves, abilities, types, egg groups and much, much more. 

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a contract that allow developers to interact with an application through a set of interfaces. In this case, the application is a database of thousands of Pokémon-related objects, and the interfaces are URL links.


## Example 1 -- Information Retrieval

This is a basic example which shows you how to retrieve the relevant information we have about a specific Pokemon.

```{r library}
library(pokemaster)
```


```{r pokedex}
pokedex(c("charizard"))
```
```{r}
pokedex(c(6))
```
In the above example, we illustrated how someone could retrieve the relevant information of the Pokémon "charizard" by its name or by its id. We can show its weight, height, base_experience, HP, attack, defense, special attack, special_defense, speed, type 1 and type 2.

## Example 2 -- Pokecard Generation

In example 2, we illustrate how you can easily create a team of Pokémons of your choice, and create a graph out of it.

```{r pokecard}
pokecard(myteam = c("pikachu","staryu", "exeggutor", "wynaut", "wailmer", "xatu"), 
         color="LightBlue", title="Best Team")
```

In the above example, we used the `pokecard` function to pick a team of Pokemons. We picked 6 Pokémons -  "pikachu","staryu", "exeggutor", "wynaut", "wailmer", "xatu" -, customized the card color to "LightBlue", and chose "Best Team" as the title for the card. You can see the `pokecard` is generated accordingly. There is nothing better than a nice flashcard of your favorite Pokémon team!


## Example 3 -- Stats analysis

In example 3, we illustrate how you can easily visualize the 6 main stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed) of your Pokémon team.

```{r pokestats}
pokestats(myteam = c("pikachu","staryu", "exeggutor", "wynaut", "wailmer", "xatu"), 
          title="Best Team")
```

In the above example, we used the `pokestats` function to plot the stats of the same Pokémon team and chose the title name "Best Team". You can see the `pokestats` barplot is generated accordingly. This is useful to analyze the stats of your team and improve it!
